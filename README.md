# Rupsy-downloader

A python script to scrape and download music from trance music site, Rupsy

This program has been developed to run on Ubuntu and should run on other debian-based distributions just fine.

To get the program running:

  1. download the repository
  2. use your terminal and navigate to the program's root directory
  3. execute the setup script with **"./setup.sh"** - this will install the necessary python packages *globally*
  4. execute the run script with **"./run.sh "** - this will start the python program using python2 interpreter
